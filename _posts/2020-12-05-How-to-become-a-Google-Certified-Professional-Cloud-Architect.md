After about two months' preparation, I got my Professional Cloud Architect certificate this week. This experience gives me a lot on Google Cloud Platform(a.k.a. GCP) and architecture design principles. The exam is not difficult at all for a veteran engineer, and I've not tried GCP before in my life. I'll explain how to pass it quickly, and how you can get the most of it rather than just a certificate.

## Why GCP Cloud Architect

According to [Canalys' report](https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-cloud-market-q320), Google only possess 7% of the whole cloud market in Q3 this year, comparing to Microsoft's 19% and Amazon's 32%. Amazon's AWS stepped into this arena first, and Microsoft Azure expands its share from Enterprise customers who using their Windows and Office. It must be very difficult for Google to catch up, so why choose GCP certificate now?
